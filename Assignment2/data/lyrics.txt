They took all the trees and put them in a tree museum
Then they charged all the people a dollar and a half just to see them.

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got till its gone.
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

From the ants in our petunia bed
To the crab grass in our lawn.
We will fight them off with chemicals
Till the bugs and weeds are gone.
We will use quarts and quarts of poison sprays
And we won't stop till we're thru.
The bugs and weeds are dying now,
But the plants and trees are, too.

Coming this Christmas to a theater near you.
The most horrifying film to hit the screen!
There's a homicidal maniac who finds a Cub scout troop!
And he hacks up two or three in every scene.
Please don't reveal the secret ending to your friends.
Don't spoil the the big surprise.  You won't believe your eyes
When you see Nature Trail to Hell
Nature Trail to Hell, Nature Trail to Hell

Nature Trail to Hell, Nature Trail to Hell

See severed heads that almost fall right in your lap.
See that bloody hatchet coming right at you.

Till we bring you Nature Trail to Hell, Part II
So bring the kids along, it's good clean family fun.
What have you got to lose? If you like the Six O'clock News,
Then you'll like Nature Trail to Hell
Nature Trail to Hell, Nature Trail to Hell
In 3-D

If everybody had an ocean, across the U.S.A.
Then everybody be surfing, like Californi-a.....

Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong,
Under the shade of a coolibah tree,
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

   Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
   You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me,
   And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled,
   You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

Down came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong,
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee,
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tuckerbag
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

   Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
   You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me,
   And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tuckerbag,
   You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

Up rode the squatter mounted on his thoroughbred,
Down came the troopers - one, two, three,
Whose that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tuckerbag?
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

   Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
   You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me,
   Whose that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tuckerbag?
   You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

Up jumped the swagman, and sprang into the billabong,
You'll never catch me alive said he,
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

   Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
   You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me,
   And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong,
   You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.

How many roads must a man walk down
before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
before she can sleep in the sand?
And how many times must the cannonballs fly
before they are forever banded?
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind.
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
